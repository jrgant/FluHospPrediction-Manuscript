Amid a growing focus on “Big Data,” it offers epidemiologists new tools to tackle problems for which classical methods are not well-suited. In order to critically evaluate the value of integrating machine learning algorithms and existing methods, however, it is essential to address language and technical barriers between the two fields that can make it difficult for epidemiologists to read and assess machine learning studies. Here, we provide an overview of the concepts and terminology used in machine learning literature, which encompasses a diverse set of tools with goals ranging from prediction, to classification, to clustering. We provide a brief introduction to five common machine learning algorithms and four ensemble-based approaches. We then summarize epidemiological applications of machine learning techniques in the published literature. We recommend approaches to incorporate machine learning in epidemiological research and discuss opportunities and challenges for integrating machine learning and existing epidemiological research methods.},

  title            = {Solving No Free Lunch Issues from a Practical Perspective},
  abstract         = {Recently the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem [3] has been a widely used as an argument in a global optimization context, which says that for any algorithm, elevated performance over one class of problems is exactly paid for in performance over another class. In sum, one should be skeptical of claims in the literature on machine learning algorithms that one being proposed is substantially better than most others. Such claims are often defended through some simulations based on applications in which the proposed algorithm performed better than some familiar alternatives. Assuming that NFL also holds for various intelligent paradigms, our first research aim is to show how an ensemble approach could be used to combine the different paradigms to benefit from the synergistic advantages of the various paradigms. Further, we illustrate how an evolutionary multiobjective optimization approach [1] could be useful to optimize the various error measures using an ensemble approach. The algorithms are validated using two function approximation problems involving prediction of stock indices for Nasdaq-100 and NIFTY [2]. The stock index time series behaves more like a random walk process and time varying. We considered 7 year's stock data for Nasdaq-100 and 4 year's for NIFTY index. Our target is to develop efficient forecast models that could predict the index value of the following trade day based on the opening, closing and maximum values of the same on a given day. The stock indices are first modeled using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Takagi-Sugeno Neuro-Nuzzy (TSNF) model, a Difference Boosting Neural Network (DBNN) and Multi-Expression Programming (MEP) algorithm. Empirical results as depicted in Figure 1 clearly indicates that none of the five paradigms could perform well to optimize the error measures considered namely Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Correlation Coefficient (CC), Maximum Absolute Percentage Error (MAP) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). To enhance the performance an Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (EMO) algorithm is proposed to ensemble the results (outputs) obtained by the five algorithms. Suppose the daily index value predicted by DBNN, SVM, NF, ANN and MEP are a n , b n , c n , d n and e n respectively and the corresponding desired value is x n. The task is to combine a n , b n , c n , d n and e n so as to get the best output value that maximizes the CC and minimizes the RMSE, MAP and MAPE values.},

Applications of the NFL theorems to information-theoretic aspects of optimization and benchmark measures of performance are also presented. Other issues addressed include time-varying optimization problems and a priori “head-to-head” minimax distinctions between optimization algorithms, distinctions that result despite the NFL theorems’ enforcing of a type of uniformity over all algorithms.},
